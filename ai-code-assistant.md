This document compiles notes I took during my test of code assistant tools.

I focused my search on tools available for Python code and on Pycharm or VSCode editors.


# Tools preview

A quick preview of each tool. I conducted tests on many of them just to check their features and ergonomics.

I did not asses quality of responses or suggestions during this preview.
